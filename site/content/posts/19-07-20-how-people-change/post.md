title: "How People Change"

I never bought the clich√© "people don't change". As someone invested in their own growth, internalizing that idea seems cynical and self-destructive. I think most of us believe _we_ have changed over the course of our lives, even if we fail to see that potential in others.

My preferred reformulation of this saying is "people do change, but rarely how or when we expect them to". A corollary is that we shouldn't expect _specific_ changes from anyone else, just Change with a capital "C". We grow how we see fit to, and we can adjust our model to expect the same of those around us.
