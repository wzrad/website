[Challenge](/blog/19/06/challenges/) #2 was given to me by my partner, Janice Cho (arguably, she also gave me [challenge #0](/blog/19/06/challenge-0/) by organizing this whole endeavor):

> Go to a yoga class by yourself :) Find your Ujjayi (victorious) breath!

Bearing direct witness to my struggles with challenges #0 and #1, I think Janice was kind to give me this challenge when she did.

I went to the noon class at Tula Yoga in Logan Square (Balanced Vinyassa). The instructor, Beverlyn, opened class asking us to identify which parts of our bodies were speaking the loudest, to acknowledge the emotions and stories that inspired that noise, and to leave them behind. To focus only on the physical sensations, at least during the class. She led through a sequence of poses and micro-movements stretching our toes, ankles, and knees.

I've had issues recently with my emotions manifesting in physical distress (as well as general problems [with my knees](/blog/19/06/unintended-consequences/)), and it was helpful to allow myself to be guided by her words. That afternoon after class, I was finally able to go out and make a breakthrough on challenge #1. Post still forthcoming.
