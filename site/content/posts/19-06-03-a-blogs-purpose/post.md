For the first 30 years of my life, I've been too scared start a blog. The thought of failing in an arena that could indicate a lack of intelligence, a lack of kindness, a lack of empathy, or an incapacity for individual thought fills me with unbearable dread. Failing as a writer feels too close to failing as a person. While this class of anxiety is probably not unique, I imagine the journey towards overcoming it _is_ different for each person. I haven't overcome it. But I am, now, committed to trying.

My anxiety of personal failure manifested as an unending stream of self-imposed barriers. There was no way I could start blogging without a compelling theme. There was no way I could post something that wasn't at least a thousand words. As a programmer, I couldn't even _begin writing_ until I'd built a polished personal site. To put anything less out there would jeopardize my career, my friendships, and who knows what else.

And the content I consume on Twitter, on blogs scattered across the Internet, and in the news is kerosene for the fire. It is written by people I admire, it is illuminating, it has depth. A neat 1:1 for the anxieties facilitating my inaction. How do people produce like this? Why can't I?

On the morning of May 12th I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1127641348843163654) by [Sara Soueidan](https://sarasoueidan.com) and read [the wonderful post it links to](https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse) by [Matthias Ott](https://matthiasott.com) about the Personal Web. Both resonated deeply with me. They present an alterative vision for a Web that I've longed for over the one we're currently captive to. A web where each individual's art is linked author-to-author, instead of a web where a perverse stone soup of authored content and corporate impersonation is linked platform-to-platform, the platforms owned by a handful of profiteers.

A few days later, on May 17th, I stumbled into this [post about forever](https://seths.blog/2019/05/three-kinds-of-forever/) on [Seth Godin's blog](https://seths.blog). I was a week away from starting the "sabbatical" I'm now on, and that post put the exact pin in the fallacy of "forever", of feeling stuck where I am now, that I needed at that moment. This was my first encounter with Seth's Blog (late to the party), and I was struck by posts like [this one](https://seths.blog/2019/05/accountability-vs-responsibility/) that, while still dense with wisdom, made no effort to manufacture unnecessary length.

So, getting to the point! Observing all these people running headlong into their art and dispensing with artifice has inspired me to give it a shot too. I'm going to attempt a daily blog. I won't impose any restrictions on the length or profundity of my posts. Just their frequency. Im going to strive to scribe my own experiences rather than judgments on the experiences of others, and, hopefully, through that lens this blog and me find a kind, humble voice.
