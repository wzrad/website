_I'm publishing this post on the 12th, but I wrote it in my head yesterday. And it's about yesterday. Whatever, we've redefined "daily", and I'm perfectly comfortable with it._

I went for a bike ride to the Chicago Botanic Gardens today. I want to do a longer ride every two weeks while it's summer and I'm unemployed. When I left in the morning, I realized that I didn't have a water bottle. I own two sport bottles, but they were nowhere to be found. I have of trouble keeping track of things, especially things I don't use frequently.

Having done a few long rides, I knew both that I needed some road snacks and that I would be extremely hungry on arrival. But the Gardens has an (expensive) cafe where I could get lunch to gather energy for the return trip, so it sholdn't be a problem. I suited up, applied sunscreen, grabbed some energy bars at the grocery store, and stopped at a bike shop to buy another water bottle (which they graciously offered to fill up for me).

Then I left. Long bike rides provide much needed space for my mind to wander. This one was no exception; it was nice. I'd texted my family to see if anyone wanted to meet up at the destination and walk around for a bit, and my step-sister volunteered to meet me. On landing I put on regular (modest) shorts and realized that I didn't have my wallet. I have trouble of keeping track of things. Rifling through my panniers didn't uncover it. I tried to call the bike shop, but for some reason just hit dead air. I had two more energy bars, didn't plan to spend too much time at the Gardens, and didn't want to impose on my step-sister. So I skipped lunch. She arrived, we walked around for a while, and we got to catch up; it was nice.

Before heading back home, I ate both my energy bars, re-applied sunscreen, and had an unsolicited bathroom conversation with a 30-ish-year-old man in a white suit and matching [panama-style hat](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=panama-style+hat&atb=v1-1&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images) about his difficulty growing a beard. The ride home wasn't fun. I haven't been riding a lot and my knee has been acting up, so I've been trying to take it easy. It was acting up, and I was also extremely hungry because I'd foolishly decided to skip lunch. About 5 miles before getting home I [bonked hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall). At this point, I couldn't think about anything except for how hot the sun was and how many streets away I was from Diversey. No space for wandering thoughts.

I _did_ eventually make it. The bike shop had my wallet and their phone system had been out for 3 hours. They also tried to send me a facebook message; it was nice. When I got home I ate everything edible in the fridge, discovered how delicious pickle juice is (it is nice), and met some friends for beer at the Map Room. I solicited some knee advice from a friend who is a PT, which I probably wouldn't have done had the ride back not been so brutal. I also remembered to close out and recover my credit card, probably because of how top-of-mind my wallet was.

A lot of nice things happened today that otherwise may not have, if not for a series of compounding errors triggered by my failure to keep track of my water bottles.
