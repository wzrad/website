In 1986, Fred Brooks published [No Silver Bullet](http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf). In this [influential paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) he made the case that we were unlikely to see 10x improvments in software development efficiency, because, he claimed, the only remaining problems meaningfully impeding our ability to write software were those inherent to the task itself. Its "essential complexity". Whether or not this prediction holds true is not the subject of this post. I find that it serves as a useful reminder. We should be wary of solutions with guarantees, that include quick fixes, or have few drawbacks.

I think it's a warning worth re-iterating, because it's one that's so easy (for myself anyways) to forget. [My optimism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias) frequently causes me to underestimate tasks and assign too much confidence to my current solutions, and this "sabbatical" has been no exception. I was convinced, in the weeks leading up my time off, that I would be able to start a broad list of new habits. I knew it would take _work_, I knew that I probably would fail on a few, but I felt generally optimistic about my ability to start small and work towards something substantive for most of them. I couldn't accomplish it while working, but if I were _not working_. How could it fail? Sure feels like a silver bullet in retrospect.

Unsurprisingly, starting all those habits was harder than I thought. Many of my struggles while working continue to be struggles while not, even with more time an energy available. The essential complexity is in my brain. There are many habits, like keeping a planner or reading every night, that I haven't found yet. I bought a planner two weeks ago and have a book by my bedside, which _is_ a start, but the planner is empty and I struggle to make it through more than a couple pages in the book before getting distracted. I have started other habits, like this blog, so I hope this isn't mistaken for a claim that the whole enterprise has been in vain. Now, hopefully, it's just be a matter of continuing to do the work. To taking small steps towards starting new habits each day.
