It's late on a Sunday night, I haven't gotten around to writing a blog post, and I feel a little too tired to write anything coherent. I did, however, spend a decent chunk of time working on an "about" page and navigation that I didn't finish.

On personal projects, discipline and prioritizing time-sensitive tasks (in this case, writing today's post) remain are a challenge for me. In order to keep pace, I imagine one mitigating strategy might be to write a few posts at once when time, energy, and ideas permit. And I'd bet this situation does happen again, because life.
