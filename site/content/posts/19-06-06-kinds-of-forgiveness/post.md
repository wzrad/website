title: "Kinds of Forgiveness"

I like this post [on apologies](https://seths.blog/2019/05/defective-apologies/) by Seth Godin. It's a little unclear if it's about apologies by humans or apologies by organizations or both. When it comes to human-to-human apologies, I find it difficult to tell the full story without simultaneously telling one about forgiveness.

Seth's post describes a few different things someone might want from an apology and how we might execute one depending on those wants. There are many different kinds and configurations of apologies, but I think there's only one kind of forgiveness. That is to let go.

It seems like there are lot of ways to get there, though. Immediately "letting go" may difficult (perhaps impossible) and psychologically dangerous. For me personally, I need to engage with my feelings, sit with them, find kind words to express them, and make them known. Sometimes that's enough. Sometimes I need an apology, too. Sometimes I just need to go on a bike ride and lay in the grass.

I'm consistently surprised by how much letting go of my body and sinking into a few tufts of grass does for my state-of-mind.
