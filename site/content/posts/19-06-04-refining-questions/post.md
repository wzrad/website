title: "Refining Questions"

Last week, I left my job to take some time off from work (I'm calling it a "sabbatical" in the hopes that it inspires me to take it seriously). I'm grateful to have this privilege and recognize that it's not a freedom available to many. Bearing the weight of this luxury in mind, I've been trying to figure out how to be as intentional, creative, and generous with this time as I can be.

It was easy to sketch out a plan for the next couple months. I feel like I could mine the mountain of if-I-had-the-time-and-energy-s that I've accumulated over the past few years working a 9-to-5 for the next decade. However, after that initial expedition I still felt like I _should_ doing something else. The (unstated) questions I'd asked myself were along the lines of "what have I wanted to finish?", "what is a skill I should start learning?", and "what do I need to do better at?". Unsurprisingly, save for a wishy-washy commitment to rejecting cynicism, most of my answers were skills and activities where I was the primary beneficiary.

It feels like a general truth (though it may only be an individual one) that we're much better at coming up with answers to questions than we are at coming up with the right questions. I think this is a generalization of an idea that the software industry, among others, at least pays lip service to. How much ink has been spilled advocating for MVPs and small, iterative experiments as the one-true-path to our apps' local maxima? The strategy does feel right. Ideally, each experiment refines its originating question and inches us closer to the right one. Once we're there, building an answer _should_ be simple (haha).

Nonetheless, I think it's easy to lose sight of this strategy, refining questions over answers, even in software where we have a powerful incentive (money) encouraging us to adopt it. It seems exceptionally easy to lose sight of it when the questions we're asking are personal or political. When they may involve us accidentally revealing uncomfortable truths about ourselves to ourselves. Or when we become so deeply involved in our well-honed answers that the opportunity cost of asking a new question feels astronomically high. I've certainly seen this in myself.

The first version of this sentence was about how I wanted to start this sabbatical by refining its guiding questions. Instead, I think this sabbatical should be about concurrently and continuously refining those questions while exploring answers to them (this is also a committment to post those questions, even if they do reveal uncomfortable truths). In a moment of weakness, I instead began by building this blog. Hopefully, the blog proves to be a tool that helps orient me towards an interrogative journey.
