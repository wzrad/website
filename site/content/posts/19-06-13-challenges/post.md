As part of my time off from work, my partner generously solicited and organized over 30 "adventure challenges" from my friends and family to push me to be uncomfortable, try new things, and challenge myself. Ideally, something that could be completed in a day.

I received the first one today, and it's a real doozy. It's the end of the day, and I haven't completed it yet. Both the challenge and the ticking clock have been causing me anxiety, but I realized late in the afternoon that I needed to accept that and forgive myself for not completing it. I am where I am now.

Even though I didn't finish, I did start, and the challenge ended up both aligning with and focusing me on things I've been thinking about the past few days. It prompted to me to draft interview questions, and I think they're a good jumping-off point for [the questions](/blog/19/06/refining-questions/) I want to iterate on throughout this journey. I also picked up the book [Designing your Life](https://designingyour.life/the-book/) mentioned in [yesterday's questions](/blog/19/06/still-no-silver-bullet/) (and hit pause on the book I'd been reading), and it did help kickstart the reading habit. I may not have haven't finished the challenge yet, but it's inspiring positive change.
