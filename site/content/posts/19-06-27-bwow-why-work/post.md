_This is a post about [my motivations](/blog/19/06/bwow-outline) for advocating equally-owned worker co-operatives._

I began attempting to enumerate a list of values for the organization I'd like to start or be a part of and then fell backwards into trying to describe the motivations for creating such an organization in the first place. And then backwards still into the question "why work at all?".

I think "work" is society's means of organizing labor in the pursuit of improving quality-of-life for its participants ("work" and "society" here referring to the abstract concepts rather than any specific implementation). I find this simple definition to be sufficient, thought it may have issues (please, point them out!). Whenever trying to understand whether or not a work-related practice or idea is beneficial, I try to refer back to it. I'm going to borrow [Fred Brooks' language](/blog/19/06/still-no-silver-bullet) from [No Silver Bullet](http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf). I think if a practice or idea facilitates our ability to organize labor and improves our quality-of-life, it is part of the "essential complexity" of working effectively. It has to do both. If it doesn't, it's the dreaded "[incidental complexity](http://wiki.c2.com/?NoSilverBullet)" (see note about "incidental" in No Silver Bullet, Refired).

Incidental complexity manifests as features of the _specific_ organizations we form to accomplish work rather than as features of work itself. They're not necessary to perform work effectively. They may have been invented (perhaps unwittingly) at our current organization, or they may be artifacts of past experiences carried on by some member(s) of the organization. They may have made sense, even addressed essential complexity, in the time and context in which they were created. Before entropy turned them incidental.

I think that eliminating incidental complexity in our working model is a goal worth striving for, though perhaps an unachievable one. Human relationships, and the networks of them that we call organizations, are too complex and change too quickly for us to realistically reach that summit. Simply _identifying_ all the sources of incidental complexity in an organization seems like a daunting or impossible task. We can, however, start with the low-hanging fruit.

For example, the organizations I've been a part of, even those that self-describe as "flat", have been plagued by (often unspoken) division and classification that has impacted both workers' quality of life and our ability to organize our labor. Our natural tendency to relentlessly classify (and to reduce, and to simplify) is helpful in some circumstances, but I think it directly diminshes and centralizes power in otherwise collaborative organizations. It's practices like these, many of which are ideas foundational to the organization's charter, that are probably the strongest candidates for elimination. Practices that fail _both_ tests for essentiality. I suspect equal-ownership can eliminate a lot these incidental divisions while preserving what's essential. I will continue to make that case throughout this series of posts.

This is the baseline I'm operating from when thinking about work and organziations, what's yours? The next post will dig into incidental division and classification in greater detail, unless I'm pushed in a different direction.
