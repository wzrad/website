[A post](https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse) about the [personal web](/blog/19/06/a-blogs-purpose/) was the genesis for this blog. That version of the web, the [independent web](https://indieweb.org), is not new, nor has it gone anywhere. It's the web before "platforms". It's the web of individually-owned, interconnected sites. It's the web where each of us has the freedom to define the shape and sheen of our digital presence. It's been de-emphasized by web centralization and a concentrated charge towards corporate ownership, but I doubt it will ever be extinguished. Decentralization is baked into the guts of the web itself, technically and spiritually.

Reading yesterday's Verge article on the [working conditions for Facebook's content moderators](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa) (_warning: horrors inside_) has reinforced my belief that an independent web is the antidote to what ails its centralized cousin. And that an antidote is _necessary_. And that, for some, it may be a matter of life and death. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter, et al. seem [incapable of moderating](https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2) their platforms, seem to lack the ethical foundation necessary [to engage with the problem](https://www.wired.com/story/why-zuckerberg-15-year-apology-tour-hasnt-fixed-facebook/), and propose [more complexity](https://www.wired.com/story/susan-wojcicki-on-youtubes-fight-against-misinformation/) as the solution their platforms' present unpredictability. An independent web, on the other hand, is self-policing. We choose the content we create, and we choose the content we link to. It's curated and intentional, rather than personalized to algorithmic stereotypes [of ourselves](https://www.wired.com/story/how-recommendation-algorithms-run-the-world/) (and reinforcing [existing prejudices](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/facial-recognition-software-controversy.html)).

Participating in online communities, even as observers, exposes us to psychological risk. Participants in an independent web are only as vulnerable to abuse as each individual allows, because we have the freedom to choose who and what we associate with. The centralized web offers a token representation of that freedom while eroding it with targeted ads and "personalization". In the interest of profitability, platforms push the working conditions of their employees to the brink of acceptability (the acceptability floor is obviously much lower for contract labor). They apply that same calculus to the web and to us. They allot us "freedom" but just enough to maximize profit. The independent web, on the other hand, is a self-assembling, continually evolving reputation network. Its participants, not its administrators, manipulate the boundaries. I think that defining our rights around ownership, in particular digital ownership, will be the defining problem of the web's upcoming era.

The personal web is less convenient than the centralized one, and inertia is not on its side. I've had a number of conversations about it recently and met varying degrees of receptivity. One thing that I've observed is that many people are reluctant to _share_ their thoughts or feelings, either out of fear of rebuke or not knowing what to say. I know I've felt that too. I've felt like I've lacked an individual voice, like my well of creativity had run dry. This blog has been invaluable in helping me dissolve those self-destructive ideas. I've also had a number of sympathetic, encouraging conversations that introduced me to efforts I was unaware of like [Solid Pods](https://solid.inrupt.com/). There's still hope.

I want to help change this conversation. I want to raise awareness around the importance of ownership. I think it's time to dust off the cobwebs. I want to help build an independent web that is accessible to and safe for everyone. It seems like now is the time to make a go of it.
