Two ideas crystallized for me recently. The first is that I shouldn't try to change anyone's mind who hasn't invited me to do so. That's not to suggest waiting until the other person offers a (now memetic) "change my mind". I think that's unlikely to happen and unlikelier still to be uttered in good faith. But it is to suggest paying close attention to non/verbal cues indicating whether the other person is willing to hear your ideas before, during, and after sharing them. But especially before.

I've comparmentalized and understood this idea in certain contexts, like software consulting, for at least a little bit. There have been two projects in my life that involved on-site, process change work. In both cases we failed to achieve our goals, I suspect (at least in part) because I was selfishly convinced of my ability to affect change simply by demonstrating a "better" way. Or even worse, baldly stating a better way. Not only did this routinely fail, but I failed to learn my lesson. It wasn't until reading through [Extreme Programming Explained](https://duck.com/?q=extreme+programming+explained) that I finally identifed my error:

> Change always starts at home. The only person you can actually change in yourself. No matter how functional or dysfunctional your organization, you can begin applying [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) for yourself...Dictating practices to a team destroys trust and creates resentment. (Beck, Andres 57)

Then last week, the compartment walls began crumbling (I suspect it will be some time before they actually fall). I tried to convince a friend of something sensitive, without invitation. It failed, obviously, and I think both of us walked away feeling unheard. It has certainly eroded trust and created resentment on my side. What's worse, I was not invited to this conversation, but at the time I thought I was. Or, at least, I expected to be.

The second crystal is that I'm capable of both _inviting myself_ into conversations and _expecting_ an invitation in return. And I need to be alert to it. It's reasonably obvious, taking a step back, to identify when somebody is questioning, conversant, and inviting new ideas vs. assertive, argumentative, and not interested in hearing them. It's more difficult in the moment. I didn't feel like my ideas were welcome, which hurt, but I hadn't done the work to make sure they were even asked for.

Inviting somebody to conversation with the _unstated_ expectation of reciprocation was selfish. I did not expect to be invited otherwise, but I wanted to try to connect. So I extended the invitation, obstensibly creating a safe space for them to express themselves. Subconciously, when I perceived I wasn't and wouldn't be invited in return, I stopped actively listening. I made that safe space into a risky one.

This may be premature after three posts, but I'm realizing that one of the things I like about blogging is that it's a context where I can express ideas without imposing on anyone or requiring invitation. Without feeling compelled to persuade. I can share my thoughts and stories freely, because I want to, rather than because I think somebody else might want/need to hear them. I am, howver, also extending this explicit invitation for you to share yours too, if you've chosen to read this (for now, anyways ;).

I think a failure to identify un/invited conversation (concious or otherwise) explains, in part, the futility of arguing with strangers on the Internet. It's more difficult to recognize an invitation from a stranger. It's more difficult to recognize an invitation when we're not face-to-face. We assume that sharing thoughts publicly is an invitation. It's often (usually?) not. This, however, is!
