My friend Chase possessed a profound, _personal_ empathy that he shared readily with anyone and everyone he met. A magnaninmity. He had an uncanny ability to make you feel heard and important in even the most minor conversation. While he may not always have been light-of-heart, he never let it stop him from making light of the situtation. He had a relentless wit, but I don't recall him ever making a joke at someone else's expense.

When he passed, it was clear that _many_ people considered Chase their best friend. I was certainly one of them. He was a best friend to total strangers. He occupied himself on weekends by wandering out into the neighborhood, striking up conversations with whomever was nearby, and listening to their stories. He lived a generative, giving life.

I think "empathy" as an idea has become somewhat overloaded. It's regularly used to describe how, at a distance, we might understand and relate to the plight of a group of people. Even more abstractly, it's used to describe how a design should orient itself with respect to its users. No doubt these are important kinds of empathy, but I find it's most potent when both personal and proximal. I think that's empath's foundation, and that emphasizing and actively working on a strong foundation is necessary for its broader, more abstract (more political) forms to find purchase.

This is how Chase expressed his empathy, and he cast it as a wide net. He connected with people generously, and he connected them to each other gracefully. His was the sort of empathy that brings together a network of individuals and erases their divisions without erasing their distinctions. That was Chase's real superpower. He built community everywhere he went. I think his disposition is rare, and wish it were less so.

In life, he taught me a lot about how to be a compassionate, kind person and a good friend. These days, he's teaching me an important lesson about the value of memory. About how we necessarily carry our sadness with us but can also find new strength in our recognition and understanding of those feelings (I could have also learned that lesson from Inside Out). I still have a lot to learn from my memory of him and the example he set. I'll always miss Chase, and I want to be the kind of person he would've been proud to call his friend.
