I want to start a series of posts about what I imagine is an ideal work environment, at least for software companies. At the core of this ideal is equal ownership. By virtue of being part of the organization, each person has a roughly equal stake (e.g. at most someone might own 1.3 shares), and the company's revenues are divided accordingly. I suspect that such a model can triage some of the corrosive forces that plague many workplaces: centralized authority, intra-office competition, poor hiring decisions, growth-fixation, an inability to properly value/recognize others' work, etc. I also just think it's a fairer way to distribute an organization's profits.

I've been reading How to Do Nothing by Jenny Odell on recommendation from an ex-coworker. It's great. In it she describes a few different attempts at utopian environments for work/education like the [Epicurean Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism) and the push in the 1970s by disaffected Aquarian youth towards rural communes (the problems they encountered, and their ultimate collapse). It reminded me that I'm more-or-less ignorant of the history of similar efforts and the how's and why's that led to their eventual outcomes.

I do need to make some updates to the blog to support a "series". I'd also like to solicit opinions from all of you about what problems you think a software company built on a foundation of equal ownership might face. I'll use those problems to frame the posts in this series. If you've got one, please communicate it to me through whatever channel and at whatever point during the series you see fit.
