[Challenge](/blog/19/06/challenges/) #1 (post forthcoming) is upon me, and I've faceplanted pretty hard. I realized that I have some personal demons to overcome that are making it exceptionally difficult.

Despite this blog _helping_ me overcome my fear of [sharing my thoughts](/blog/19/06/a-blogs-purpose/), I'm still afraid of sharing them and I'm still _horribly_ afraid of failure. This first challenge feels so overwhelming not only because it's legitamitely challenging, but because I'm consumed by the fear of failing at it publicly. Private failure is humiliating enough. Failing in front of my friends and family feels catastrophic.

This is a self-centered lens. Failure is something that I need to embrace, not only for my own growth, but to demonstrate humanity and fallibilty to those close to me. To everyone, really. To err alongside them. We all deserve the courage to fail, knowing that others will still accept us. I need the courage to fail publicly and the confidence that I'll still be accepted for myself, but also to help others find that same courage and confidence.
