[Challenge](/blog/19/06/challenges/) #6 was given to me by my friend, Adam Selzer (thanks Adam!).

> There's something about job hunting that can make the world's resources feel limited. As if your wealth is limited to the numbers in your bank account. As if your options are limited to job postings online. It's a good time to remember the feeling abundance and how readily available it is. Dedicate a morning or afternoon to Experiencing Wealth. To proceed, take $100 out of your bank account and break it into the following denominations: (1) Twenty (4) Tens (6) Fives (5) Ones and $5 in quarters. Over the course of 2 hours, find ways of giving/contributing these \$100 to others in the most meaningful, magical ways you can. Could be in one sum. Could be across 20 different sums. Could go to a stranger or could go to a friend. The gift could get attributed to you or it could be anonymous. Know that you have more than enough. Know that contribution is your highest calling. Know that the same life can be viewed through the lens of unbelievable bounty and terrifying scarcity.

In addition to delivering a great challenge, Adam also sent over this beautiful write-up. Wow! I can attest, having completed the challenge, that it was Well Designed. It succeeded in creating space for me to contemplate these ideas and, more importantly, to feel them.

Abundance was on my mind throughout the challenge, but perhaps because of where [my head is at these days](/blog/19/07/challenge-1-humans-of-chicago) it quickly wound its way around to community and neighborhood, too. The means I discovered for giving were intended to draw people to details in our shared surroundings (and services) that I think are hidden or special. To create or augment experiences that connect us to those we share physical space with, even if those connections are anonymous.

_(1) Twenty went to my local library's late fee slush fund (this term may be a pejorative, but I'm not sure what to substitute). Public services are important, and nobody should be discouraged from using them!_

_(1) Ten was stashed in the "Bowie Box", a CD-share nailed to a tree that originally contained its creator's collection of David Bowie albums. The bill was nestled into a map I drew revealing the location of a tree in Palmer Square Park significant to Janice and my relationship. Alongside the map was a note entreating whoever finds it to go enjoy the tree as much as we have (it has a great branch for reclining)._

Janice pointed out to me that, in pursuit of the "magical" and "meaningful" criteria, I leveraged a lot of anonymity and surprise. While describing the ways I chose to experience wealth, she shared her thoughts on the slightly different paths she would have tread. Each of them was a "why didn't I think of that" moment.

_(1) Five was hidden under an empty bottle of Malta Goya left on the windowsill of a local business. Hopefully it doesn't get washed away by the wind and rain before someone decides to clean it up._

_(1) Ten and $5 in quarters were used to create an altar to Alexander Hamilton at the [solar observatory](https://www.the606.org/visit/arts/statement-from-the-leader-artist/) at the end of the 606. Originally I intended to leave a trail of quarters to a $10 taped underneath one of the outdoor chess sets at Paseo Prairie Park, but there was no way for me to do it discreetly._

While it was rewarding to do this challenge on my own, sharing the experience with her and others was a reminder of the recursive, generative nature of our capacity to connect. Each individual connection strengthens the web a little bit (and maybe ensnares somebody new), and the stronger and more vast that web becomes, the more frequent and more powerful each subsequent connection is.

_(5) Ones and a description of the challenge went to my friend Zack so that he could, hopefully, share in the experience himself and with others beyond my immediate reach._

As my funds dwindled, I began thinking about my role in the challenge. I felt that, in some ways, I was acting as arbiter in my ability to choose how I distributed the money and to whom.

_(1) Ten and (1) Five went to Marcello, who I interviewed during [Challenge #1](/blog/19/07/challenge-1-humans-of-chicago) and reconnected with during this one._

_(1) Ten went to a woman running a [Piragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piragua) stand on an unbearably hot summer afternoon. The coconut Piragua was incredible, and I'm a fool for never having gone before!_

Once that thought took hold, it was tough to shake. I felt uncomfortable with having that control. Who am I to decide what's fair and who should receive what? I wanted to devise a strategy for giving the money away that deprived me of agency. I settled on procedure.

_(4) Fives went to strangers at a bus stop. I sat down after the bus left. As a one person "flash mob", I agreed with myself to stand up as soon as four people arrived and hand each of them (1) Five (for fare, which I didn't think to mention). Only two people showed up by the time the bus came, so I gave each of them (2) Fives as they boarded._

A quick accounting will reveal that to be \$100. I was reminded throughout the day of book I learned about a couple years ago, [Shareable Cities](https://www.shareable.net/sharing-cities/), but never got around to reading. It's a repository of ideas and tactics for injecting more shared spaces, and with them the potential for shared experiences, into our neighborhoods. It was on my mind frequently as this challenge took shape, and I'm inspired now to try and put it into practice.
