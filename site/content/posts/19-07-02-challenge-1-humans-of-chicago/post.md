[Challenge](/blog/19/06/challenges/) #1 was given to me by my friend, Adrianna Misterka (thanks Adrianna!).

> Find 3 people (one must be a senior citizen) and interview for a quote or short story about their live. Like a "Humans of New York" thing.

Oof. Janice handed me this challenge on day one, and the thought of it quickly [wound me into a stress-knot](/blog/19/06/challenge-0-failure).

I've always struggled with social anxiety, and the idea of approaching strangers unsolicited _and_ creating conversation with them was (and is) terrifying. I think the lens that permits these involute, anxious contortions is ultimately a self-centered one, and mine was in desperate need of re-grinding. I'm extremely grateful, both for this challenge and for receiving it so early in the process, because it forced me to do just that (or to start, anyways). To confront those feelings, and my general fear of failure, and discover new perspectives with which to see and understand them.

The challenge itself was rewarding in ways I couldn't have predicted, and it has rendered me more open and engaged with people in all areas of my life. I think all the clich√©s about the benefits of meeting new people are true: it exposed me to unfamiliar perspectives, it opened unseen doors, and it focused my own direction and sense of purpose.

I think I've had more (off-the-record) conversations with strangers in the three weeks I've been working on it than I've had in the last year. I haven't had every conversation with every stranger that I could have or wanted to. The fear is still there, but each passing conversations lessens it. The sense of connectedness that inpsires has opened my eyes to a different way of living. To life, really. It has sparked joy.

But I think the biggest change that both this challenge and the people I spoke to inspired in me is a newfound belief in the organizing power of neighborhoods and local, physical communities. And a profound sense of how lost on us the importance of participating in these human networks is in the Internet era.

It's an unfortunate irony of our extremely-online world that we're lonelier, more isolated, and less secure in our immediate, physical surroundings. We find safety and community on the web, but we don't know the people who live next door (much less those that live a block away). The decline in neighborhood particpation can't be laid at the feet of Internet technologies; it's undoubtedly more nuanced than that. However, I think they've greased the slope. It's my personal, unresearched opinion the division inherent in that decline has hamstrung not only our ability to commune with strangers, but also our capacity for individual empathy and our representation at all political tiers.

We don't know who lives in our neighborhood, so we're more afraid to walk around outside at night. We're disconnected from our neighborhood's history and from people outside our own socio-economic strata, so the life-altering effects of gentrification seem remote and inevitable. We don't participate in local political organizations, so our broader movements, organized on the Internet (and often virally), are as chaotic and unstable as their medium. The Internet is a powerful organizing tool, but I think its insufficency as our _sole_ organizing tool weakens us both personally and politcally.

However, I'm optimistic about the potential of in-person community organizations to slowly roll the boulder back up the hill. When I mentioned that this challenge has focused my own direction and sense of purpose, this is that direction. Participation. By joining the organizations near me (like the [LSNA](http://www.lsna.net)) trying to build an inclusive neighborhood and by tirelessly connecting with people to develop our shared neighborhood identity. My hope is twofold. First, that I can help tackle these problems where I have the best chance for effect, and second that by strengthening such organizations we'll have the framework to work with other similar organizations on broader, more challenging problems. And so on and so forth.

[My friend Chase](19/06/my-friend-chase) always said to me that he thought local politics were the highest-impact outlet for our political energy. I wrote it off at the time, but I think, now, that he was dead on.
