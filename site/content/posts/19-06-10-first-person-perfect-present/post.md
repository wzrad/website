I'm deliberate on this blog about leaning heavily on the first-person pronouns "I" and "we". It tends to require a lot of editing. In real life especially, I'm bad about flat-out asserting things and am constantly trying to correct myself. While the first-person isn't always appropriate, I think they've been unfairly maligned in our upbringing and education. I think they're typically the more honest option, especially when we find ourselves struggling to omit them. I think they're more inclusive and less othering than the second- and third-persons.

When I was in school we were trained to avoid using phrases like "I think" and "I feel" in expository & academic writing (which was everything we wrote). Heck just throw "I" out the window altogether. Observe the position from afar! It's certainly not yours. Why would you remind the reader that you or any other fallible sack of meat wrote it?

One common rationale for this is that it makes our writing seem more formal, more objective. This argument seems _insane_ to me. It seems to advocate for deliberately blurring the lines between our opinions and "Objective Truth". I was similarly encouraged to avoid qualifying or weakening phrases like "often", "sometimes", and "in my opinion", and I think the reasoning continues to fall down there too. My goal in writing is not to [persuade](19-06-05-inviting-conversation) the reader, it's to present my thoughts as fairly as I can.

I'd like my writing to be both honest _and_ clear. Not one at the expense of the other. There are many things I say that are my opinion, that I'm not sure about, and that require qualification. I don't see how we we can walk around being 100% of everything we say and do 100% of the time. 10% sure 20% of the time hews a bit closer to how I feel, and I want to make sure that feeling lands with whomever I'm speaking to.

This argument seems too obviously bad, so I went searching for something to pull apart my straw man and stumbled into this [StackExchange post](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/7184). It hits the mark for me. I've also been on a longer-than-a-decade crusade to eliminate passive voice from my writing (thanks Microsoft Word). I like abstractions, and organizing everything around "emphasis" is a neat tool for deciding when [not] to use the first-person. However, I would opt for "failing to indicate my opinion here may mislead the reader" as the trigger to first-person, instead of "your opinion is itself the subject".

Having a heuristic is always handy. I've definitely been struggling with "I"-overload in these posts. Writing, perhaps more than many arts, does need to consider form. Without form, reading becomes tedious. It's not fun anymore, and it's easier to lose interest. Who wants that? Not I.
