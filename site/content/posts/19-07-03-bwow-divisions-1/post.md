_This is a post about [my motivations](/blog/19/06/bwow-outline) for advocating equally-owned worker co-operatives._

In the [previous post in this series](/blog/19/06/bwow-why-work), I worked though one answer to the question "why work at all?" and used that answer as a test to distinguish between essential and incidental organizational complexity. One feature of organizations that I suspect has a high rate of incidentality is their tendency to divide and classify their employees.

Classification is a necessary tool. It's impossible to understand anything without some means of decomposing it into smaller sub-things. However, it's also a heuristic. Grouping two different things into a single bucket necessarily simplifies some nuance. We hope what we reduce away is irrelevant, but in my experience this sort of erasure is fraught. Choosing the wrong classifier or misclassifying an entry is common enough to appear constant. I think classification, when applied to human beings, is exceptionally fraught. We (sort of) understand at a cultural level the destructive history (slash potential) of misclassifying human beings and/or classifying them at all, and on a personal level I bristle when I'm classified in a way that I feel is unfair. It's reasonable to assume incidental classifications also exist in the workplace.

Any classification necessarily begets division. In workplaces, specifically, I think that many commonly implemented classifications fail one or both essentiality tests, and the divisions they sow have a destructive effect on our ability to work effectively. I have, for example, observed division by compensation, by present skillset, by tenure, by discipline (design/development/management/etc), by perceived value all have what I consider to be negative effects on both individual well-being and labor organization. I'll expand on these examples in the next post. Essential vs. incidental is one way to classify classifiers in the workplace, but I think there are a few other useful meta-classifiers:

- **Temporary vs. Permanent**\
  Can the classification change over time or is it permanent
- **Contextual vs. Ubiquitous**\
  Is the classification used only in certain contexts or always

I think striving to eliminate incidental divisions is a goal worth striving for. They produce distributions of power and authority that will feel unfair to some of us, reduce morale, and ultimately lead to burnout. When they're implicit or unspoken, they construct unnecessary barriers to communication and collaboration that results in lost information, reduced work quality, or even project failure. Dispensing with any concern for productivity, they can become internalized but unfelt components of our identities, causing cognitive dissonance and psychological pain. Organiztional policy determinining or designing any component of someone's identity is illiberal and wrong. Incidental divisions are toxic for a whole host of reasons.

Not having had the opportunity to test it, I think that equal ownership may heal many incidental divisions. Some such divisions should be eliminated completely. Others may only be incidental until re-aligned along another meta-classifier. For example, I'd claim that ubiquitous divisions in authority are incidental. They tend to inhibit communication and bottleneck decision making, reducing our capacity to organize labor effectively. They tend restrict the agency and freedom of those with less authority, reducing their quality of life. However, they can be made contextual by confining them to a single project, and they can be made temporary by rotating roles regularly throughout a project's lifetime. This preserves authority's essential quality, its capacity to bias a group towards action, while filling in some of the gaps that made its ubiquity incidental.

I began listing some kinds of classification that I think exist in the workplace on paper, and in the next post I'll try and break some of them down along the different meta-classifiers. If there are any divisions that pop into your head, essential or incidental, send them my way!
