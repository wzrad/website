I've been frustrated, particularly these past few months as I've focused on non-programming tasks, by the constant interruptions posed by my phone and computer. Reading has been a challenge. Simple tasks have become ordeals. It's been hard for me to escape connection long enough to think a complete thought or finish a single page. As I left my job, a co-worker recommended that I check out [How To Do Nothing (Resisting the Attention Economy)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-to-do-nothing-resisting-the-attention-economy/oclc/1085144412) by [Jenny Odell](http://www.jennyodell.com), and after a [less than a month](/blog/19/06/still-no-silver-bullet) I've finished it!

It's a difficult book to summarize (though [her talk by the same name](https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb) provides a good intro), so I recommend just reading it. In any case, to take a stab, I think it presents the argument that we should work to reclaim control over our attention by intentionally constructing space for our mind (and body) to wander (and wonder). That's the titular "Nothing". To reclaim that control requires that we develop an awareness of and resistance to the Attention Economy, the socio-technological structures that seek to direct our attention (feeds, filter bubbles, notifications, "productivity") rather than provide us the freedom to choose its target. That's the titular "Do". Individually, we may rediscover _our_ unique perspective on the world and eschew the one prescribed to us. Collectively, we gain the ability to negotiate that diversity of perspectives to improve the very same world. It turns out that doing nothing is active, curious, and constructive rather than inert.

I loved this book and will probably prostyletize it, to a point of irritation, if we see each other in meatspace. It aligns neatly with many of the things I've been thinking about: the tech reckoning, [the independent web](/blog/19/06/dust-off-the-cobwebs), [utopian-ish collaboration](/blog/19/06/bwow-why-work), [broadly-defined ecology](https://www.worldcat.org/title/sand-county-almanac/oclc/999355608), socialism.

Her writing has widened my view in many of these domains and helped me hold my attention on others that previously I previously hadn't. That is a major beat of the book, actually, that the "reality" we know is a negotiation between our attention (map) and the world (territory). And that both those entities are malleable. Jenny Odell leans heavily on one of her hobbies, birdwatching, for examples in the book. Before birdwatching, the local birdsong appeared to her to just be noise, a nonfactor in her conscious understanding of the neighborhood. After birdwatching, the same birdsong instead piqued a curiousity that in turn revelead new layers of reality. That new reality included not only the birds themselves, but their environments, the creatures with whom they co-habitate, a sense of their history, a sense of their habits, etc. It added to reality an understanding that each of these new things was as significant a feature of the world as anything else, including humans.

We aspire, some of us anyways, to understand the world as comprised of other people whose lives are as important, dense, and meaningful as our own. Fewer of us ascribe that same value to animals. Fewer still ascribe that same value to plants. Fewer still ascribe that same value to the soil. And so on. The farther removed from "humanity" something is, the more we struggle to value it. Ultimately, we're _choosing_ to draw the value line somewhere that's explicable or personally convenient (e.g. plants are "unconscious" and thus of lower value than animals). Perhaps the actual solution is to draw no line at all.

I think this idea is a sibling to naturalist and ecologist Aldo Leopold's [Land Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_ethic) (who is quoted a few times in the book). Leopold argued that we would continue to destroy the environment unless we developed a socio-cultural understanding of _the land_, meaning the nonhuman world, as at least as valuable as humanity. We would need to make another crack in the lens of "self". That lens was evolutionarilty convenient when our populations were sparse, but I think it's ultimately an illusion. There's no me. We're multitudes.

I give this book a solid "purchase a copy or check it out from the library as soon as possible".
